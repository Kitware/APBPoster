AutoPyBind11
############

A C++ to Python interoperability convenience tool. 


AutoPyBind11 is a lightweight python based tool designed to simplify the process of generating and maintaining Python bindings for C++.

AutoPyBind11 takes C++ source code and associated, user generated, descriptor files, and produces `PyBind11`_ binding code, which are then compiled into
libraries containing a Python module representation of the provided C++.


`PyBind11`_ is a C++ header only library that supports the binding and exposure of C++ code to Python.

This tree serves as partial documentation and a tutorial for the use of AutoPyBind11, and the source code can be found `here`_

AutoPyBind11 is an active and ongoing effort, and as of the writing of this document, there is no extant stable version, and API/useage details are apt to change with minimal warning.


AutoPyBind11 provides as close to a complete coverage of PyBind11's features as is possible, and more covereage is being added consistently.
